Minimal [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) sample app.

## Requirements

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `de.codecentric.springbootsample.Application` class from your IDE.


```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Accces console H2

If you want to access visit the page and view of the data base, acces in  :

``` shell
https://localhost:port/h2-console
```

This will create:

* A Web Application called "AutomovilController"
* Service called "AutomovilService"

If you want to access the code, you have  springboot service:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/facundocardenas11/Automovil-Concesionaria.git
```

```shell
cd Automovil-Concesionaria
```

```shell
git pull
```
